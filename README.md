# RNN_learning_group
This is a repository for learning RNN.
This repositor is made for sharing codes and references. Feel free to use this git hut for getting accustomed to git hub. 

If you try to edit others' code, make a branch ( one of the system of git hub)  and ask them whether that change is acceptable or not.
